# Virtual Network
- After enabling the server mode, other machines can connect as clients to this server. Each client will create a virtual IP on the computer. On Windows, the program **must be run in Administrator mode** to create a virtual IP.  
  A client can also connect to a server on the same machine by setting the server IP to `localhost`.

- P2P originally used **UDP hole punching**, but due to heavy restrictions by Chinese ISPs (especially China Mobile, which often blocks UDP in many regions), this feature has been **removed and is no longer maintained**.

# DDNS
Currently, only **Tencent Cloud** is supported.  
Introducing SDKs from other providers would significantly increase the project size, so support for more providers may be added gradually in the future.

# Static Resource Routing
You can configure a static file path. After setting the API (must start with `/api` by default), resource files can be accessed via HTTPâ€”similar to using **nginx**.

# Custom API Routes
Supports user-defined API endpoints.  
This is useful for scenarios like **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

# Custom Login Auth
Only used during login.  
Can be used to log login events or implement SSO.

# Bookmarks
This is a **bookmark manager**, used for saving links to other websites hosted on the server.

# System Performance
Displays various system resource usage stats.  
You can choose whether to enable **real-time monitoring**.  
On Linux, clicking the memory card icon in the menu allows you to view mounted disks and **edit the disk mount configuration file**.
