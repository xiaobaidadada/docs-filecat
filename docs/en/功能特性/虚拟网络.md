## 📡 Filecat Usage Guide

### 🔧 Overview

- **Server Mode**: When Filecat is started in server mode on a computer, other computers can run the client mode to connect to this server. Each client creates a virtual IP on the local system. On Windows, this requires running Filecat with administrator privileges.
- **Local Connection**: A client can also connect to a server running on the same machine by simply setting the server IP to `localhost`.
- **P2P Notice (UDP Hole Punching)**: Filecat previously supported P2P communication via UDP hole punching. However, due to heavy restrictions by Chinese ISPs—especially China Mobile—UDP is often unreliable or blocked in many regions. As a result, this feature has been removed and is no longer maintained.

## 🚀 Steps to Use

1. Install and start Filecat in server mode on a computer with a public IP address.
2. Install Filecat on other computers that **do not have public IPs**, configure the server key, port, and other settings, then start the client mode. Each client sets its own virtual IP.
3. Once connected, all clients can communicate with each other over the virtual network.
4. **Note**: On Windows, the virtual network created by Filecat is set to **Public** by default. You must manually change it to **Private** in order to allow ICMP (ping) traffic. However, this does not affect normal communication.
5. The server can also run a client instance and connect to itself. This allows the server to actively send requests to clients located behind NATs or without public IPs.

## 🔁 TCP Proxy Function

With the TCP proxy feature enabled, the server can access other hosts within the client’s local network.

## 🔐 Change Network Profile (Public → Private)

```powershell
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias "filecat" -NetworkCategory Private
```

### ✅ Check if the change was successful:

```powershell
Get-NetConnectionProfile
```
