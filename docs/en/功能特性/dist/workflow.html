<p>This is a workflow feature that uses GitHub-style workflow syntax (YAML format). You can create a file with the <code>.act</code> extension, then right-click the file to see an execution option.</p>
<h1>Use Cases</h1>
<ul>
<li>Personal or internal automation build tools, similar to Jenkins</li>
<li>With permission controls, editing and execution rights can be assigned based on user roles</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to Use</h1>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>.act</code> file</li>
<li>Define <code>name</code>, <code>job</code>, and other steps</li>
<li>Right-click to execute and monitor real-time progress</li>
<li>After execution, a history button will appear in the current menu bar</li>
<li>In settings, you can also configure a remote trigger API, which can be used for Git hooks to trigger automatic builds</li>
</ol>

      </div><h2>Core Syntax</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each file must have a <code>name</code></li>
<li><code>env</code> can be used to provide environment variables</li>
<li><code>jobs</code> defines multiple job tasks, each of which is a set of sequential commands. All commands in a job run within a single shell environment. You can use <code>cd</code> for relative path switching. If one command fails, the entire job fails.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Advanced Syntax</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each job and command can be conditionally executed using <code>if</code></li>
<li><code>import-files</code> allows importing other YAML files, and <code>use-yml</code> can reference them</li>
<li><code>inputs</code> also serves as environment variables, which can be filled in from the UI when right-clicking the file; these override <code>env</code> variables with the same name</li>
<li>If a job's <code>repl</code> is set to true, all commands are sent to the terminal as one session. For example, if the first command is <code>ssh aaa@www</code>, the remaining commands will be input as if typed into the shell (e.g., password)</li>
<li>A job can use <code>need-job</code> to wait for another job to finish before running; by default, all jobs run in parallel</li>
</ol>
