<h1>File Management (Not for Cloud Disk Access, Future Development Not Planned)</h1>
<p>Supports various file editing and preview operations.</p>
<h1>Supported Preview File Types</h1>
<ul>
<li>Images, videos, Markdown, Excalidraw (whiteboard drawing), and other formats supported by the browser (such as PDFs).</li>
</ul>
<h1>File Compression/Decompression</h1>

<h1>Large File Breakpoint and Chunked Uploads</h1>
<ul>
<li>The default method is <strong>HTTP upload</strong>. You can set the maximum upload concurrency in the <strong>Settings - Environment</strong> section. For directories that meet certain criteria, <strong>chunked uploads</strong> will be used (via WebSocket). Different upload modes are used for different directories, which allows for optimizing the concurrency for different types of hard drives (e.g., mechanical hard drives).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1>Protected Paths</h1>
<ul>
