<h2>📡 Filecat Usage Guide</h2>
<h3>🔧 Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server Mode</strong>: When Filecat is started in server mode on a computer, other computers can run the client mode to connect to this server. Each client creates a virtual IP on the local system. On Windows, this requires running Filecat with administrator privileges.</li>
<li><strong>Local Connection</strong>: A client can also connect to a server running on the same machine by simply setting the server IP to <code>localhost</code>.</li>
<li><strong>P2P Notice (UDP Hole Punching)</strong>: Filecat previously supported P2P communication via UDP hole punching. However, due to heavy restrictions by Chinese ISPs—especially China Mobile—UDP is often unreliable or blocked in many regions. As a result, this feature has been removed and is no longer maintained.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 Steps to Use</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install and start Filecat in server mode on a computer with a public IP address.</li>
<li>Install Filecat on other computers that <strong>do not have public IPs</strong>, configure the server key, port, and other settings, then start the client mode. Each client sets its own virtual IP.</li>
<li>Once connected, all clients can communicate with each other over the virtual network.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: On Windows, the virtual network created by Filecat is set to <strong>Public</strong> by default. You must manually change it to <strong>Private</strong> in order to allow ICMP (ping) traffic. However, this does not affect normal communication.</li>
<li>The server can also run a client instance and connect to itself. This allows the server to actively send requests to clients located behind NATs or without public IPs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🔁 TCP Proxy Function</h2>
<p>With the TCP proxy feature enabled, the server can access other hosts within the client’s local network.</p>

<h2>🔐 Change Network Profile (Public → Private)</h2>

      <div class="code-block-with-copy">
        <button class="copy-btn" data-code="Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias &quot;filecat&quot; -NetworkCategory Private" >复制</button>
        <pre><code>Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias &quot;filecat&quot; -NetworkCategory Private</code></pre>
      </div><h3>✅ Check if the change was successful:</h3>

      <div class="code-block-with-copy">
        <button class="copy-btn" data-code="Get-NetConnectionProfile" >复制</button>
        <pre><code>Get-NetConnectionProfile</code></pre>
