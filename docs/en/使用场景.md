# File Server
- Supports previewing various file formats including images, videos, markdown, and more.
- Breakpoint resume for file uploads.
- Team support: different users within a team can have access to different file directories based on permissions.
- Convenient features like Recycle Bin and multiple root directories.
- Supports editing images and drawing notes.
- Online file extraction (unzip) support.

# Server Panel
- Provides a convenient terminal experience using the custom-built `pty-shell.js` virtual terminal for FileCat. This offers a full terminal interface with permission filtering, preventing team members from executing malicious commands.
- Monitor server resources such as CPU, disk usage, and perform disk mount configuration easily.
- Includes `systemctl` management support, a feature currently missing in other mainstream server panels.
- Docker management: view container logs, start/stop containers, and more.
- Real-time monitoring of all running processes on the server. Implemented in C++ for excellent performance — unlike other tools that consume high CPU, FileCat provides lightweight, efficient real-time process monitoring.

# Large Log File Viewer
Instantly open and view even very large text files (currently supports UTF-8 encoding only).

# CI/CD Automation Tool
Built-in workflow engine using GitHub Actions-compatible syntax — a lightweight alternative to Jenkins for build automation.

# Accessing Private Network Devices (No Public IP)
Through Windows remote control proxy and browser proxy functions, you can access internal-only resources — such as a router’s admin panel or a home Windows PC that has no public IP — from outside the local network.

# Unified Access Control for Multiple Linux Servers
With SSH proxy support, you can save and manage multiple remote SSH accounts, enabling seamless remote file management and terminal access as if working locally.

# Web Bookmark Manager
Save addresses of web projects hosted on the server, with support for organizing bookmarks in a multi-level folder structure.

# Server-side HTTP Download
Use HTTP proxy to send requests and download resources directly from the server in the background.

# Static Resource Proxy
Serve multiple directories as static resources, with support for single sign-on (SSO) and customizable login mechanisms.

# Target Users
- Developers with personal servers, especially those who build and manage home servers.
- Small developer teams needing shared access to server files, command execution, and CI/CD tasks.
- Companies looking for internal tools for automated builds and resource distribution.
- Solo developers who need a comprehensive tool for development, operations, build, and monitoring — an all-in-one power tool.
