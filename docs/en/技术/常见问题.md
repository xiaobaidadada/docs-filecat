# Error During `npm install`

Some dependencies are downloaded from GitHub, which can be unstable to access from mainland China. Neither `cnpm` nor `yarn` can fully resolve this issue.  
If you encounter persistent problems, consider installing a C++ build environment, along with Python, Visual Studio, and `node-gyp`.

# Why Use Node.js for the Backend

- Using Node.js allows both frontend and backend development in JavaScript, making development more convenient.
- Since this is a server management tool focused on file read/write, configuration updates, command execution, and network forwarding, Node.js is suitable despite being single-threaded. These system I/O APIs are handled concurrently at the OS level. Using `await` or `.then`, the results are queued and executed in the single-threaded JavaScript runtime.
- For features that require computation, such as process resource monitoring and full-text file log searches, these are offloaded to worker threads and executed in parallel, so they don't block the main thread.
- Node.js interacts with C++ easily. At one point, I wanted to experiment with building a VPN — many VPN-related projects are written in C++. Node.js makes integration and packaging with C++ straightforward, which isn’t as convenient in other languages like Java.
- `filebrowser` uses Go for its backend. While Go indeed has lower memory consumption, I personally don’t like Go’s syntax. Considering the above points, I chose not to use Go.
