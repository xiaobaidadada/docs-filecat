# Project Architecture
Built on **Node.js**, using TypeScript. HTTP functionality is handled with **routing-controllers** and **express**. WebSocket is used for persistent connections. The frontend is built with **React**, and the styling is largely copied from [filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser).

So you only need to be familiar with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React.js**. For learning these technologies, [Runoob (Rookie Tutorial)](https://www.runoob.com/) is a great resource to get started. The best way to learn is by developing while learning—there's no need to master everything beforehand.

# Development Steps
1. Clone the project:  
   `git clone https://github.com/xiaobaidadada/filecat.git`
2. Run development server:  
   `npm run dev`
3. Build the project:  
   `npm run build`
4. To contribute a pull request:
  - Bug fixes can be submitted anytime.
  - For new features, it's recommended to discuss them in the QQ group first.

# Backend
- HTTP features are built using `routing-controllers` and `express`. Combined with TypeScript, the development experience is similar to Java’s Spring Boot. Routes are defined using decorators above function names.
- WebSocket routes are also implemented using a decorator-based system, achieving the same effect as `routing-controllers`.
- Some submodules like `node-process-watcher` are implemented in C++. When installing the project, if GitHub is slow to access, local compilation is required. This needs a build environment. Check the homepage for solutions. The project currently does not support macOS, mainly because these submodules might not compile successfully on macOS (and I don’t have a Mac to test).
- Some of the larger, original features developed in this project include a virtual VPN, workflow automation builder, virtual terminal (pty-shell), and large file log viewer. These are all original designs.  
  There's also an RDP-based remote desktop feature, which reuses code from other projects. I modified it slightly. As far as I know, only MeshCentral has implemented a Node.js-based RDP proxy for remote access.
- Originally, I used `node-pkg` for binary packaging, but it is no longer maintained. Now, binary packaging includes `node.exe` directly.
- WebSocket communication uses `proto` (protobuf). It can also support `socket.io-parser`. Since proto can transmit binary data and I started with WebSocket (not socket.io), both proto and socket.io-parser encoding versions are implemented.
- The database uses multiple JSON files. Even SQLite is not used, because there’s no need. The project rarely generates large amounts of data. JSON is sufficient.  
  For logs in workflows (which can be large), I built a custom document-style logging database that doesn’t support deletion yet but performs well.  
  This custom solution reduces external dependencies and allows more flexible operations in the future. I thought it was fun and plan to keep improving it.
- Both frontend and backend are bundled using Webpack.
- Login state doesn't use JWT; instead, it uses an in-memory token variable. You can customize the session timeout and invalidate all tokens when needed.

# Frontend
- Built with React and uses the CSS from the `filebrowser` project. I created several reusable components. The structure is simple, and all components are written as functional components.
- Global state management is done using `recoil`.
- Other frontend dependencies are introduced only to support specific features.
- This project does not include dynamic loading animations and never will. I think such animations are unnecessary—it's better to focus on improving performance.
