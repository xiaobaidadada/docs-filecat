<h1>File Server</h1>
<ul>
<li>Supports previewing various file formats including images, videos, markdown, and more.</li>
<li>Breakpoint resume for file uploads.</li>
<li>Team support: different users within a team can have access to different file directories based on permissions.</li>
<li>Convenient features like Recycle Bin and multiple root directories.</li>
<li>Supports editing images and drawing notes.</li>
<li>Online file extraction (unzip) support.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Server Panel</h1>
<ul>
<li>Provides a convenient terminal experience using the custom-built <code>pty-shell.js</code> virtual terminal for FileCat. This offers a full terminal interface with permission filtering, preventing team members from executing malicious commands.</li>
<li>Monitor server resources such as CPU, disk usage, and perform disk mount configuration easily.</li>
<li>Includes <code>systemctl</code> management support, a feature currently missing in other mainstream server panels.</li>
<li>Docker management: view container logs, start/stop containers, and more.</li>
<li>Real-time monitoring of all running processes on the server. Implemented in C++ for excellent performance — unlike other tools that consume high CPU, FileCat provides lightweight, efficient real-time process monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Large Log File Viewer</h1>
<p>Instantly open and view even very large text files (currently supports UTF-8 encoding only).</p>
<h1>CI/CD Automation Tool</h1>
<p>Built-in workflow engine using GitHub Actions-compatible syntax — a lightweight alternative to Jenkins for build automation.</p>
<h1>Accessing Private Network Devices (No Public IP)</h1>
<p>Through Windows remote control proxy and browser proxy functions, you can access internal-only resources — such as a router’s admin panel or a home Windows PC that has no public IP — from outside the local network.</p>
<h1>Unified Access Control for Multiple Linux Servers</h1>
<p>With SSH proxy support, you can save and manage multiple remote SSH accounts, enabling seamless remote file management and terminal access as if working locally.</p>
<h1>Web Bookmark Manager</h1>
<p>Save addresses of web projects hosted on the server, with support for organizing bookmarks in a multi-level folder structure.</p>
<h1>Server-side HTTP Download</h1>
<p>Use HTTP proxy to send requests and download resources directly from the server in the background.</p>
<h1>Static Resource Proxy</h1>
<p>Serve multiple directories as static resources, with support for single sign-on (SSO) and customizable login mechanisms.</p>
<h1>Target Users</h1>
<ul>
<li>Developers with personal servers, especially those who build and manage home servers.</li>
<li>Small developer teams needing shared access to server files, command execution, and CI/CD tasks.</li>
<li>Companies looking for internal tools for automated builds and resource distribution.</li>
<li>Solo developers who need a comprehensive tool for development, operations, build, and monitoring — an all-in-one power tool.</li>
</ul>
