## ‚ùó macOS Support Notice

Currently, **macOS is not officially supported**.  
Some core features are written in C and are **not cross-platform compatible**.  
Since I don't have access to a Mac device, it's **very likely** that the software won't compile or run properly on macOS.

> **However, you can still run Filecat on macOS using Docker.**

## üöÄ Installing & Running Filecat

### 2.1 Using npm

#### 1. Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g filecat
```

If you're in China, use a faster mirror:

```bash
npm install -g filecat --registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

#### 2. Run Filecat

```bash
filecat --port 5567
```

#### 3. Open in Browser

Go to: [http://localhost:5567](http://localhost:5567)  
Default username/password: `admin` / `admin`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

- Some native modules are prebuilt and hosted on GitHub (supported Node.js versions: 16, 18, 20, 22).
- If GitHub is slow or blocked, installation may fail. You can try installing dependencies manually.

- If installing via npm fails due to GitHub issues, please use the **binary release** or **Docker** method below.
- For Windows build issues, see this article: [CSDN Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/jjocwc/article/details/134152602)

### 2.2 Binary Release

3. Open a Command Prompt as **Administrator**, then run:

```bash
nssm install filecat
```

4. A GUI window will appear ‚Äî set the path to `start.bat`.
